# Hi, I'm Mitch! I help products<br/> and product teams fly! ðŸš€

I am a post-technical product and engineering leader with `23+` years of experience in software engineering, product management, and engineering management. In 2024 I have returned from a <a href="https://nomadmo.re/maps/2023-world/">career break traveling in Europe</a> with my wife.

I have been a remote worker for `12` years, and I've spent `7` years as a digital nomad. During that time I visited `32` countries and worked from `336` distinct locations. Check out my travel map of locations <a href="https://nomadmo.re/maps/the-full-travel-map/">here</a>.
